1. Mark the day the solution was prepared, the concentration and the pH.
2. To make 0.1M NaPO4: Weigh 1.1694g NaH2PO4 and 5.9181g NaHPO4 in a 300mL beaker.
3. Dissolve NaH2PO4 and NaHPO4 using approximately 200mL dH2O.
4. Adjust pH=7.5 using 0.1N NaOH.
5. Transfer solution into 250mL volumetric flask and fill dH2O to calibration line.
6. Mix solution by inverting the volumetric flask.  

# B. Reagent Preparation: Preparing 12.0mL of 6 M GuHCl 
1. Mark the day the solution was prepared, the concentration, and volume onto laboratory tape and place in 50 mL falcon test tube.
2. Weigh 6.8782 g of GuHCl and place into 50mL falcon test tube. 
3. Add 6.30 mL of 0.1M NaPO4 buffer (pH 7.5) and dissolve GuHCl to obtain a final volume of 12.0mL.

# C. Reagent Preparation: Preparing 15.0mL of 0.01M DTNB stock solution and 0.001M of DTNB (1:10x dilution)

# E. Reaction Mixture Preparation
1. Collect 15 glass test tubes and label the first test tube in each row A-E. 
- Where A test tubes had [NAC] = 0 µM. 
- B test tubes had [NAC] = 5 µM. 
- C test tubes had [NAC] = 10 µM. 
- D test tubes had [NAC] = 30 µM. 
- E test tubes had [NAC] = 60 µM. 
2. Pipette 750µL of 6M GuHCl to each test tube 
3. Pipette 100µL of 0.001M DTNB to each test tube
4. Pipette corresponding 0.1M NaPO4 (pH 7.5) volume according to table.
