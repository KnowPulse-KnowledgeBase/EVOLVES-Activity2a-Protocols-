2. To make 0.1M NaPO<sub>4</sub>: Weigh 1.1694g NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and 5.9181g NaHPO<sub>4</sub> in a 300mL beaker
3. Dissolve NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and NaHPO4 using approximately 200mL dH<sub>2</sub>O 
4. Adjust pH=7.5 using 0.1N NaOH 
5. Transfer solution into 250mL volumetric flask and fill dH<sub>2</sub>O to calibration line
6. Mix solution by inverting the volumetric flask 

### 3.B.Preparing Lentil Extract 
1. If preparing lentil extract of more than one lentil genotype, ensure 50mL falcon test tubes are clearly labelled with corresponding genotypes.  
2. Weigh 0.500g of lentil flour genotype into 50mL falcon test tube (triplicates of each lentil genotype was prepared). 
3. Add 10mL of 0.1M NaPO<sub>4</sub> to each 50mL falcon test tube 
4. Use vortex mixer on auto speed 10 to thoroughly solubilize the pellet 
5. Place in waterbath at room temperature (~24°C) for an hour 
6. Filter extract using vacuum filter apparatus under water suction 
- Attach 125 mL sidearm flask to water suction tube 
- Use Buchner funnel, 125mL sidearm flask, and Whatman #1 filter paper and ensure pre-wetting filter using dH<sub>2</sub>O 
- Turn vacuum filter on by rotating it counterclockwise 1.5x 
- Turn off vacuum filter after dH<sub>2</sub>O  is collected in 125mL sidearm flask  
- Turn back on vacuum filter by rotating it counterclockwise 1.5x
- Pour lentil extract in Buchner funnel while vacuum filter is running and use 125mL sidearm flask to collect filtered extract 
- Pour filtered extract into new 50mL falcon test tube
7. After filtering is done, pipette aliquots (3-4mL) of lentil extract into separate 50mL falcon test tubes for unheated group and remaining for heated group 
- Label test tubes accordingly to indicate corresponding lentil genotypes and heated and unheated groups 
8. Place heated 50mL falcon test tube lentil extract (in triplicate) in waterbath at 90°C
9. Place unheated lentil extract (in triplicate) in separate waterbath at ~24°C

### 4.B.Reagent Preparation: Preparing 15.0mL of 0.01M DTNB stock solution and 0.001M of DTNB (1:10x dilution) 
10.	Mark the day the solution was prepared, the concentration, and the volume. Place onto 15 mL falcon tube.  
11.	To make 15.0mL of 0.01M DTNB stock solution: Weigh 0.059454g of DTNB and dissolve in 15.0mL of 0.1M NaPO<sub>4</sub> buffer (pH 7.5)
12.	To make 2.20mL of 1:10x DTNB dilution: Pipette 220µL 0.01M DTNB stock solution and 1.98mL of 0.1M NaPO<sub>4</sub> buffer (pH 7.5). This volume is suitable for more than 21 sample test tubes aka 3 different lentil genotype extracts (both heated and unheated) and triplicate blanks.  
13.	Mix thoroughly by flicking test tube back and forth with index finger

### 4.C.Reaction Mixture Preparation 
1. Collect a total of 21 glass test tubes and label first test tubes in each row A-G. Where A is one lentil genotype (heated), B is one lentil genotype (unheated), C is different lentil genotype (heated), D is same lentil genotype as C (unheated), E is another different lentil genotype (heated), F is same lentil genotype as E (unheated), G is triplicate blanks 
2. Pipette 750µL of 6M GuHCl in each test tube 
3. Pipette 100µL of 0.01M DTNB in each test tube 
4. Grab the lentil genotype extract both heated and unheated versions, and pipette 32.5µL of heated extract into corresponding test tubes. Then pipette 32.5µL of unheated extract into corresponding test tubes. Switch pipette tips between unheated and heated versions and different lentil genotype extracts. 
650µL*(1 protein)/(20 NaPO<sub>4</sub> buffer)=32.5µL protein extract for each test tube 
Where 650µL is total of protein extract and NaPO<sub>4</sub> buffer according to (Mession, Chihi, Sok, Saurel 2015). 
5. Pipette 617µL of NaPO<sub>4</sub> buffer into each test tube
6. Mix reaction mixture thoroughly by flicking test tubes back and forth with index finger. 
7. Incubate test tubes in dark at room temperature for 10min.
8. Turn on spectrophotometer and set wavelength to 412nm. 
9. Immediately after 10 mins, record absorbance readings at 412nm using disposable cuvettes.

-**BSA equivalents are expressed in µM ∴ 1 mL = 1000µL**
-**Multiplied by 100 to determine mg/mL soluble protein with appropriate dilution factor (1:100x dilution)**

**This equation accounts for the same protein concentration of lentil genotypes and not the volume**
